# Future game

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekampp/future_game.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ekampp/future_game)

This is an online, turn-based futuristic, post apocalyptic game, which
basically is a project to make the best of merging design, programming and
project management and to sharpen our (the members of the dev-team) ruby,
rails, css, html and js skills.

## How do I play?

At the moment, we -- unfortunately -- don't have a working domain. This is
something, that we are actively trying to better, and to have a working demo
soon.

## Helping out

We are always on the lookout for people who would like to help out, so please:
Write up issues as you find them, and if you make pull requests that woul be
even better.
